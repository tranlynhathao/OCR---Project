## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project. The project aims to develop a system that can recognize text within images or scanned documents.

## Features

- Text recognition from images
- Support for various languages
- Preprocessing techniques for improving accuracy
- Export recognized text to different file formats

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OCR---Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd WebbApp
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. To adjust the workspace directory in the ```app.py``` and ```deeplearning.py``` files, you need to modify the paths where necessary.

5. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Upload an image containing text to the application.
2. Click on the "Recognize" button to perform text recognition.
3. View the recognized text on the screen.
4. Optionally, export the recognized text to a file.

## Technologies Used
